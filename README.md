# Art with Amanda 

Art with Amanda is a full-stack e-commerce website that I developed as my final milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute. As an artist, I built this platform using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase and sell my original artworks and prints. With Stripe integration for secure payments, the website provides a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore a diverse collection of my artwork, view detailed descriptions, and make purchases seamlessly. This project not only highlights my artistic endeavors but also demonstrates my proficiency in web development, combining my passion for art with modern technologies to create an engaging online gallery experience.

### Continuous Improvement

User feedback remains an important part of Art with Amanda's ongoing development and growth strategy. I will continue to actively seek suggestions and feedback from the audience throughout the development process, periodically asking for input on my Instagram and from friends and family.

## Database schema 

## Wireframes
In the initial stages of designing Art with Amanda, I created rough sketches to visualize the layout and structure of the website. These sketches served as a blueprint for the final wireframes and helped shape the overall user experience. Below are the images of these sketches:
- [Photo 1](documentation/Wireframes1/IMG_3139.jpg)

- [Photo 4](documentation/Wireframes1/IMG_3142_2.jpg)

### Final Wireframes

After refining my initial sketches, I created detailed wireframes using Figma, a versatile and powerful design tool known for its collaborative features and ease of use. Figma allowed me to add images and create precise, polished representations of the website's layout. Below are the finalized wireframes:

#### Home Page

For the home page, I developed two different options and sought feedback from the Instagram community, as well as from family and friends, to determine which layout they preferred. The majority favored the first layout, so I decided to proceed with this design.

- **Option 1**: [View Wireframe](documentation/FinalWireframes/wf1.png)
- **Option 2**: [View Wireframe](documentation/FinalWireframes/wf2.png)
- **Phone View**: [View Wireframe](documentation/FinalWireframes/homepagephone.png)
- **Tablet View**: [View Wireframe](documentation/FinalWireframes/homepagetablet.png)

#### Shop Page

The shop page was designed to provide a seamless shopping experience across different devices. It features a clean layout that highlights the products, with easy filtering and sorting options to help users find what they are looking for quickly. The wireframes include detailed views for different devices:

- **Desktop View**: [View Wireframe](documentation/FinalWireframes/contactpagedesktop.png)

#### Account/Login/Sign Up Page

The account, login, and sign up pages were designed to streamline the user authentication process, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. These wireframes include the following features:

- **Account Page**: Allows users to view and update their personal information, manage their password, and view their order history.
- **Login Page**: Provides a simple and secure interface for users to enter their credentials and access their accounts. It includes options for forgotten passwords and social media logins.
- **Sign Up Page**: Offers a straightforward registration form for new users, with fields for necessary personal information and security features to protect user data.

#### Shopping Bag Page

The shopping bag page wireframes were designed to provide users with a clear overview of their selected items, allowing for easy modifications to quantities and facilitating a straightforward checkout process. Key features include:

- **Item List**: Displays all selected items with thumbnails, names, prices, and quantity selectors.
- **Total Price**: Shows a summary of the total cost.
- **Checkout Button**: A prominent button that directs users to the secure checkout page.
- **Remove Item Option**: Allows users to easily remove items from their shopping bag.

### Next Steps

With the wireframes finalized, I used them as a blueprint during the development phase to ensure the website aligns with the chosen layout and effectively meets user needs.

## Colour Scheme

In developing the Art with Amanda website, I prioritized a modern and simplistic design to ensure that my artwork remains the focal point. Based on user feedback, I selected a colour palette consisting of different shades of white and black. This neutral colour scheme helps to create a clean, elegant, and professional look that doesn't distract from the art photos.

<details>
<summary>Colour Palette</summary>
<br>
<img src="documentation/colourpalette.png">
</details>

The following is an overview of how the colour scheme is applied across different sections of the website:

- **Backgrounds**: The primary background colour is white, providing a bright and clean canvas for the artwork.
- **Text**: The main text colour is black, and white on dark backgrounds, ensuring high readability and contrast.
- **Borders and Dividers**: A light grey is used for subtle borders and dividers, adding structure to the layout without drawing attention away from the artwork.
- **Buttons and Links**: Buttons and interactive elements are styled in a black shade to stand out and be easily identifiable.

### User Feedback Integration

The decision to use a simple and neutral colour scheme was directly influenced by user feedback. Through preliminary discussions and Instagram polls, users expressed a preference for a minimalist design that highlights the artwork rather than the website itself. By adopting this feedback, the final colour scheme enhances the user experience and ensures that the artwork remains the central focus of the site.

By maintaining a consistent and simplistic colour scheme, the website provides a cohesive and enjoyable user experience that directs attention to the artwork while ensuring readability and ease of navigation.

## Typography

The typography for the Art with Amanda website is inspired by my logo, which features the Arapey font. To complement Arapey, I researched fonts that pair well with it and discovered Raleway. This combination was recommended by a resource on the best free Google Fonts, which you can find [here](https://daveyandkrista.com/best-free-google-fonts/#:~:text=Arapey%20would%20look%20great%20in,serif%20like%20Questrial%20or%20Raleway.).

### Font Choices

- **Arapey**: This elegant serif font is used for the headings. Its classic and sophisticated style adds a touch of refinement to the website, making it ideal for drawing attention to key areas like titles and section headers.
- **Raleway**: This clean and modern sans-serif font is used for body text. Ralewayâ€™s readability and contemporary appearance provide a nice contrast to Arapey, ensuring that the content is easy to read and visually appealing.

### Application

The consistent use of these two fonts helps to create a cohesive and elegant look throughout the website. Here is how they are applied:

- **Headings (Arapey)**: All major headings, including section titles use the Arapey font. This helps to create a hierarchy and guide the userâ€™s attention to important information.
- **Body Text (Raleway)**: All body text, including descriptions and general content, uses the Raleway font. This ensures that the text is clear and easy to read, contributing to a pleasant user experience.

By carefully selecting and pairing these fonts, the website achieves a harmonious visual experience that enhances readability while maintaining an elegant and professional appearance. This thoughtful typography choice reflects the overall aesthetic of the Art with Amanda brand, balancing artistic elegance with modern design principles.

## Imagery

The imagery for the Art with Amanda website plays a crucial role in showcasing the artwork in its best light. All photographs of my art are captured using an iPhone 12, which is the primary camera I have available. I aim to capture the artworks as close to their real appearance as possible, with minimal editing to ensure authenticity and preserve the artwork's natural beauty.

### Photography Process

1. **Capture**: Using the iPhone 12, I carefully photograph each artwork to ensure that the colours are accurate and the details are captured as they appear in real life.
   
2. **Minimal Editing**: After capturing the photos, I may do some simple edits to enhance the photograph and ensure it accurately represents the artwork's beauty. This may include adjusting brightness, contrast, and colour saturation to match the artwork's true appearance.

### Importance of Authentic Imagery

Authentic and high-quality imagery is crucial for an online art gallery as it allows potential buyers to see the artwork in detail and make informed decisions about their purchases. By using the iPhone 12 as my primary camera and minimizing editing, I ensure that each piece is represented authentically, creating a compelling visual experience for visitors to the website.

### Sample Photographs

Here are some examples of the artwork photographs taken with the iPhone 12 for the Art with Amanda website:

- [Photo 1](documentation/Imagery/jake_drawing.jpg)
- [Photo 2](documentation/Imagery/IMG_3255.jpg)
- [Photo 3](documentation/Imagery/zoOQO.jpeg)

These photographs demonstrate the clarity, detail, and colours captured with the iPhone 12, providing potential buyers with a true-to-life view of the artwork available for purchase.

## Mockup
For the Art with Amanda website, I created mockups to visualize the layout and design before development. These mockups were created using Wix, allowing me to experiment with different designs and user interfaces. Mockups help in understanding the overall structure of the website and provide a preview of how the final product will look and feel.

### Mockup Tool Used

I used **Wix** to create the mockups for Art with Amanda. Wix's drag-and-drop interface enabled me to design and customize various elements of the website easily.

### Screens Mocked Up

I created mockups for six key screens to explore different aspects of the website:

1. **Home Page**: This includes the main landing area, about the artist, and navigation.

2. **Artwork Listing Page**: A page showcasing all artworks with filtering and sorting options.

3. **Artwork Detail Page**: Detailed view of a single artwork with description, price, and options to purchase.

5. **Contact Page**: Form for visitors to reach out to Amanda for inquiries, commissions, or collaborations.

6. **Shopping Cart and Checkout**: Layout for viewing items in the cart, adjusting quantities, and completing the purchase through Stripe integration.

### Benefits of Mockups

- **Visualization**: Mockups provide a visual representation of the website's structure and layout.
- **Feedback**: They help gather feedback from stakeholders and potential users before development.
- **Planning**: Mockups aid in planning the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.

### Example Mockup

Below is an example of the mockup for the Home Page created using Wix:

- [Home Page Mockup](documentation/Screenshot%202024-06-17%20at%2019.39.39.png)

### Next Steps

With the mockups finalized, I used them as a reference during the development phase to ensure the website aligns with the original vision and meets user needs effectively.

# Rationale for Development

The development of Art with Amanda was driven by several key factors:

1. **Market Demand**: There is a growing demand for unique, accessible, and online artwork purchasing options. This website aims to meet this demand by providing a platform for art enthusiasts to discover and purchase original artworks and prints.

2. **Personal Brand Growth**: As an artist, creating an online presence is crucial for expanding reach and establishing a brand. This website serves as a central hub for showcasing my work and interacting with potential buyers.

3. **User-Centric Design**: By prioritizing user feedback and involvement, the website development process ensures that the end product is aligned with user needs and preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.

4. **Technology Integration**: Leveraging modern web development technologies, such as Django for the backend and Stripe for secure payments, ensures a robust, scalable, and secure platform.

5. **Educational Milestone**: This project represents a significant milestone in my web development education, demonstrating the practical application of skills learned during my Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute.

We have been using the sqlite3 database in development, however this is only available for use in development so we will need to create a new external database which can be accessed by Heroku.

1. Go to the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) dashboard and click the create new instance button on the top right.
2. Name the plan (your project name is a good choice), select tiny turtle plan (this is the free plan) and choose the region that is closest to you then click the review button.
3. Check the details are all correct and then click create instance in the bottom right.
4. Go to the dashboard and select the database just created.
5. Copy the URL (you can click the clipboard icon to copy)

#### **Heroku app setup**

  1. From the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click the new button in the top right corner and select create new app.
  2. Give your app a name (this must be unique), select the region that is closest to you and then click the create app button bottom left.
  3. Open the settings tab and create a new config var of `DATABASE_URL` and paste the database URL you copied from elephantSQL into the value (the value should not have quotation marks around it).

#### **Preparation for deployment in GitPod**

1. Install dj_database_url and psycopg2 (they are both needed for connecting to the external database you've just set up):

   ```bash
   pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
   ```

2. Update your requirements.txt file with the packages just installed:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

3. In settings.py underneath import os, add `import dj_database_url`

4. Find the section for DATABASES and comment out the code. Add the following code below the commented out database block, and use the URL copied from elephantSQL for the value:

    (NOTE! don't delete the original section, as this is a temporary step whilst we connect the external database. Make sure you don't push this value to GitHub - this value should not be saved to GitHub, it will be added to the Heroku config vars in a later step, this is temporary to allow us to migrate our models to the external database)

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('paste-elephantsql-db-url-here')
    }
    ```

5. In the terminal, run the show migrations command to confirm connection to the external database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

6. If you have connected the database correctly you will see a list of migrations that are unchecked. You can now run migrations to migrate the models to the new database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Create a superuser for the new database. Input a username, email and password when directed.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. You should now be able to go to the browser tab on the left of the page in elephantsql, click the table queries button and see the user you've just created by selecting the auth_user table.
9. We can now add an if/else statement for the databases in settings.py, so we use the development database while in development (the code we commented out) - and the external database on the live site (note the change where the db URL was is now a variable we will use in Heroku):

    ```python
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
          'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')
          }
        }
    ```

10. Install gunicorn which will act as our webserver and freeze this to the requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

11. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory. This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which runs gunicorn and serves our django app. Add the following to the file (making sure not to leave any blank lines underneath):

    ```Procfile
    web: gunicorn art_with_amanda.wsgi:application
    ```

12. Log into the Heroku CLI in the terminal and then run the following command to disable collectstatic. This command tells Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:

    ```bash
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
    ```

13. We will also need to add the Heroku app and localhost (which will allow GitPod to still work) to ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] in settings.py:

    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['{heroku deployed site URL here}', 'localhost' ]
    ```

14. Save, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub. You can then also initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with:

    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a {app name here}
    git push heroku main
    ```

15. You should now be able to see the deployed site (without any static files as we haven't set these up yet).

16. To enable automatic deploys on Heroku, go to the deploy tab and click the connect to GitHub button in the deployment method section. Search for the projects repository and then click connect. Click enable automatic deploys at the bottom of the page.

#### **Generate a SECRET KEY & Updating Debug**

1. Django automatically sets a secret key when you create your project, however we shouldn't use this default key in our deployed version, as it leaves our site vulnerable. We can use a random key generator to create a new SECRET_KEY which we can then add to our Heroku config vars which will then keep the key protected.
2. [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) is an example of a site we could use to create our secret key. Create a new key and copy the value.
3. In Heroku settings create a new config var with a key of `SECRET_KEY`. The value will be the secret key we just created. Click add.
4. In settings.py we can now update the `SECRET_KEY` variable, asking it to get the secret key from the environment, or use an empty string in development:

    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', ' ')
    ```

5. We can now adjust the `DEBUG` variable to only set DEBUG as true if in development:

    ```python
    DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
    ```

6. Save, add, commit and push these changes.

### Setting Up AWS Hosting for Static and Media Files

#### **Creating and Configuring an S3 Bucket**

1. **Sign In and Create a Bucket**: Log into your [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com). Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket. Name the bucket after your project and choose the region closest to you. In the object ownership section, select "ACLs enabled" and "Bucket owner preferred." Uncheck "Block all public access" and acknowledge the warning to make the bucket public. Click "Create bucket."

2. **Enable Static Website Hosting**: Select your newly created bucket, go to the "Properties" tab, find the "Static website hosting" section, and enable it. Choose "Host a static website" and set `index.html` and `error.html` as the documents (even though they won't be used).

3. **Set Bucket Policy**: In the "Permissions" tab, copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name). Go to the "Bucket Policy" section, click "Edit" and open the policy generator. Set the policy type to "S3 bucket policy," allow all principals by entering `*`, and select the "GetObject" action. Paste the ARN you copied and add a `/*` at the end. Generate the policy, copy it, and paste it into the bucket policy editor. Click "Save."

4. **Configure CORS**: Edit the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings by pasting the following JSON:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
    ```

5. **Adjust ACL Settings**: In the Access Control List (ACL) section, enable "List" for everyone (public access) and acknowledge the warning.

#### **Creating AWS IAM Groups, Policies, and Users**

1. **Create a User Group**: Navigate to IAM by clicking "Services" on the top right. In the IAM dashboard, go to "User groups" and click "Create group." Name your group (e.g., `manage-seaside-sewing`).

2. **Create a Policy**: Click "Create policy." In the JSON tab, import the managed policy "AmazonS3FullAccess." Modify the resources by making it an array and pasting the bucket's ARN twice, adding `/*` to the second one. Click "Next: tags," "Next: review," and then "Create policy."

3. **Attach Policy to Group**: In the IAM dashboard, go to "User groups," select your group, and go to the "Permissions" tab. Click "Add permissions," choose "Attach policies," select your policy, and click "Add permissions."

4. **Create a User**: Go to "Users" in the IAM dashboard and click "Add users." Name the user (e.g., `seaside-sewing-staticfiles-user`), select "Programmatic access," and click "Next: permissions." Add the user to your group, then click "Next: tags," "Next: review," and "Create user." Download the CSV file with the access key and secret access key.

#### **Connecting Django to S3**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install `boto3` and `django-storages` and update `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip3 install boto3 django-storages
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Update Django Settings**: Add `storages` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`. Add the following configuration for S3:

    ```python
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
        AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
            'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
            'CacheControl': 'max-age=9460800',
        }
        
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```

3. **Configure Heroku**: In Heroku, add the following config vars:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | --- | ----- |
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | The access key from the CSV file |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | The secret access key from the CSV file |
    | USE_AWS | True |

4. **Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC**: If set, remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from Heroku.

5. **Create `custom_storages.py`**: Create a file called `custom_storages.py` in your project root. Import `S3Boto3Storage` and define custom storage classes for static and media files:

    ```python
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = 'static'

    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = 'media'
    ```

6. **Update `settings.py`**: Add the following to configure static and media file storage:

    ```python
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```

7. **Deploy to Heroku**: Save, commit, and push your changes to Heroku. Verify in the build log that static files are collected, and check your S3 bucket for the static folder.

8. **Create Media Folder**: In your S3 bucket, create a new folder named `media` for storing media files.

#### **Setting Up Stripe**

1. **Add Stripe Keys to Heroku**: Log into Stripe, go to "Developers" > "API keys." In Heroku, add the following config vars:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | --- | ----- |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | Your Stripe publishable key |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Your Stripe secret key |

2. **Add Webhook Endpoint**: In Stripe, go to "Webhooks," click "Add endpoint," and enter your site's webhook URL. Select all events and create the endpoint. Add the webhook signing secret to Heroku as `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`.

3. **Update `settings.py`**: Add the Stripe keys to your settings:

    ```python
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```
