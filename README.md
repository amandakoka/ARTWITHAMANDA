# Art with Amanda 

Art with Amanda is a full-stack e-commerce website that I developed as my final milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute. As an artist, I built this platform using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase and sell my original artworks and prints. With Stripe integration for secure payments, the website provides a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore a diverse collection of my artwork, view detailed descriptions, and make purchases seamlessly. This project not only highlights my artistic endeavors but also demonstrates my proficiency in web development, combining my passion for art with modern technologies to create an engaging online gallery experience.
