                    <p class="fs-4">Welcome to my world of art! I’m Amanda, a beginner artist from the UK.
                         My journey into art started in high school, where I discovered a newfound love for creating.
                          Growing up, I admired my older brother’s artistic talents; he took GCSE Art and his creativity always inspired me. 
                          After he passed away, I found comfort in art, using it as a way to remember him and keep his memory alive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">Taking GCSE Art myself was a transformative experience. 
                        I loved every aspect of it and continued to pursue my passion through A-Level Art and Design. 
                        During this time, I experimented with various mediums and techniques, exploring abstract concepts and discovering new artistic expressions.
                         Despite this exploration, pencil drawing—a medium my brother loved—always drew me back. 
                         It’s where I find my deepest connection to art.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">In recent years, I have been devoted to creating art, finding joy in the process of making and experimenting.
                         Art has become a way for me to express myself and share my journey with others. 
                         I’m excited to share my artwork with you through my shop, where you can find unique pieces for sale. 
                         Additionally, I’ve created a Gallery page where you can view all my works and see the evolution of my artistic journey.
                          Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy exploring my creations!
